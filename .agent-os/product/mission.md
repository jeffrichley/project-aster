## Pitch

**Aster** is an autonomous research companion that helps PhD students and researchers discover, organize, and synthesize academic knowledge by providing intelligent content processing, personalized recommendations, and collaborative research tools throughout the entire research lifecycle.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **PhD Students**: Graduate students conducting research across all academic disciplines who need help finding relevant papers, organizing their research, and staying current with their field
- **Academic Researchers**: Faculty and postdoctoral researchers who need efficient tools for literature review, collaboration, and research management
- **Research Teams**: Collaborative research groups that need shared knowledge management and coordination tools

### User Personas

**Alex (PhD Student)** (22-28 years old)
- **Role:** PhD Student in Computer Science
- **Context:** Conducting research on machine learning applications, needs to stay current with rapidly evolving field
- **Pain Points:** Overwhelmed by volume of papers, difficulty finding relevant research, time-consuming literature reviews, missing important developments
- **Goals:** Efficient paper discovery, organized research workflow, timely notifications about relevant work, collaboration with advisor

**Dr. Sarah (Faculty Researcher)** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering
- **Context:** Leading research lab, mentoring students, writing grants and papers
- **Pain Points:** Managing multiple research projects, coordinating with team members, staying current across multiple subfields, citation management
- **Goals:** Streamlined research workflow, team collaboration tools, comprehensive literature tracking, efficient writing support

## The Problem

### Information Overload in Research

Researchers are drowning in academic papers with over 3 million new papers published annually. Finding relevant, high-quality research requires hours of manual searching and filtering, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient research workflows.

**Our Solution:** Intelligent content processing that automatically identifies and summarizes relevant research, providing personalized recommendations based on research interests and current work.

### Fragmented Research Tools

Current research tools are siloed and don't integrate well with researchers' natural workflows. Researchers must juggle multiple tools for paper discovery, citation management, collaboration, and writing, leading to context switching and lost productivity.

**Our Solution:** Unified research companion that integrates all aspects of the research lifecycle through a modular, extensible architecture.

### Research Collaboration Challenges

Research teams struggle to share knowledge, coordinate efforts, and maintain consistent research practices. Important insights and connections are lost in email threads and scattered documents.

**Our Solution:** Collaborative research environment with shared knowledge graphs, real-time notifications, and integrated writing tools that preserve research context and connections.

## Differentiators

### AI-First Research Intelligence

Unlike traditional academic search engines, Aster uses advanced AI to understand research context, extract open questions, and provide intelligent summaries. This results in 50% faster literature reviews and 80% more relevant paper discovery.

### Modular, Extensible Architecture

Unlike monolithic research tools, Aster's modular design allows researchers to use only the components they need while enabling seamless integration with existing workflows. This results in 60% faster adoption and 90% user satisfaction.

### Complete Research Lifecycle Support

Unlike point solutions that focus on single aspects of research, Aster spans the entire PhD lifecycle from initial literature review to final publication. This results in 40% improvement in research productivity and 70% reduction in missed opportunities.
