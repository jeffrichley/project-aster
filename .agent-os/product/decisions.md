## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

**Aster** - An autonomous research companion designed to support the complete PhD lifecycle through intelligent content processing, personalized recommendations, and collaborative research tools. The system will be built as a modular, scalable architecture with 13 specialized modules, starting with an MVP-first approach focused on the "slim workflow" for paper discovery and processing.

### Context

The research landscape is overwhelmed with academic papers (3+ million annually), fragmented tools, and collaboration challenges. Researchers need an integrated solution that spans the entire research lifecycle from initial literature review to final publication. The MVP approach focuses on establishing core data processing capabilities before expanding to advanced intelligence and collaboration features.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - Pros: Simpler initial development, easier deployment
   - Cons: Difficult to scale, hard to maintain, limited flexibility for different use cases

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Independent scaling, technology flexibility
   - Cons: Complex orchestration, network overhead, operational complexity

3. **MVP with Full Feature Set**
   - Pros: Complete functionality from day one
   - Cons: Longer time to market, higher risk, complex initial development

### Rationale

**Modular Architecture**: Chosen for scalability, maintainability, and the ability to develop modules independently while maintaining clear interfaces.

**MVP-First Approach**: Reduces risk, enables faster user feedback, and establishes core value proposition before adding complexity.

**Slim Workflow**: Focuses on the most critical user need (paper discovery and processing) while building foundation for advanced features.

**PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Provides vector search capabilities without the complexity of specialized vector databases in MVP phase.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market with MVP
- Reduced development risk
- Clear development phases and milestones
- Scalable architecture for future growth
- Focus on core user value proposition

**Negative:**
- Initial feature set limited compared to full vision
- Requires careful module integration planning
- May need architectural adjustments as system grows
- Dependency on external AI APIs for core functionality

## 2024-12-19: MVP Technology Stack Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

**MVP Technology Stack**: FastAPI (Python) backend, React/Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL + pgvector for data storage, OpenAI/Claude for AI capabilities, Docker/Kubernetes for deployment.

### Context

Need to balance development speed, scalability, and maintainability while ensuring the technology stack supports the MVP slim workflow requirements.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + Vue.js**
   - Pros: Rapid development, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Less suitable for real-time features, limited TypeScript support

2. **Node.js + Express + React**
   - Pros: JavaScript throughout, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Less suitable for AI/ML workloads, Python ecosystem better for research tools

3. **Specialized Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)**
   - Pros: Optimized for vector search
   - Cons: Additional complexity, cost, and operational overhead

### Rationale

**FastAPI**: Excellent for async operations, automatic API documentation, and Python ecosystem integration for AI/ML.

**React/Next.js**: Mature ecosystem, strong TypeScript support, excellent for interactive research interfaces.

**PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Provides vector search without additional infrastructure complexity.

**OpenAI/Claude**: Industry-leading language models for content processing and generation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Strong Python ecosystem for AI/ML
- Excellent developer experience
- Proven technology stack
- Good performance characteristics
- Strong community support

**Negative:**
- Python backend may have higher memory usage
- Requires careful API rate limit management
- Dependency on external AI services

## 2024-12-19: MVP Feature Scope Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead, Development Team

### Decision

**MVP Feature Scope**: Focus on 6 core modules implementing the slim workflow: aster_watcher, aster_indexer, aster_digestor, aster_question_miner, aster_ranker, and aster_bloom. Abstract-only processing, web-only interface, simple ranking algorithm.

### Context

Need to define clear MVP boundaries to ensure focused development and timely delivery while establishing foundation for future phases.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Full Feature Set in MVP**
   - Pros: Complete functionality from launch
   - Cons: 12+ month development timeline, high risk, complex initial release

2. **Minimal MVP (Search Only)**
   - Pros: Very fast development, low risk
   - Cons: Limited value proposition, difficult to differentiate from existing tools

3. **MVP with PDF Processing**
   - Pros: More comprehensive content analysis
   - Cons: Significant complexity, longer development time, higher computational requirements

### Rationale

**Slim Workflow**: Addresses core user need (finding relevant papers) while building foundation for advanced features.

**Abstract-Only**: Reduces complexity while still providing significant value through intelligent processing.

**Web-Only Interface**: Faster development, broader accessibility, easier deployment and updates.

**Simple Ranking**: Establishes baseline performance that can be improved in future phases.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- 8-week development timeline
- Clear success metrics
- Manageable scope and risk
- Strong foundation for future phases
- Focused user testing and feedback

**Negative:**
- Limited initial feature set
- May not meet all user expectations
- Requires clear communication about future roadmap
- Some advanced features delayed to later phases

## 2024-12-19: Development Phasing Decision

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

**5-Phase Development Approach**: MVP Foundation (8 weeks), Intelligence & Learning (8 weeks), User Experience & Collaboration (8 weeks), Specialized Research Tools (8 weeks), Platform & Enterprise Features (8 weeks).

### Context

Need to balance rapid delivery with comprehensive feature development while managing risk and resource allocation.

### Alternatives Considered
