Here’s a **mega, detail-packed blueprint** for **Aster** — your autonomous “literature-as-an-academic-starburst” platform, wrapping up your entire PhD research workflow:

---

## Aster: The All‑In‑One PhD Research Engine

> **Mission**: From initial idea and exploration all the way to publication — Aster handles your information pipeline intelligently, continually, and autonomously.

---

### 1.  Discovery & Ingestion

* **Sources**

  * arXiv, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, conference sites (ICRA, IROS, RSS, IEEE CASE), GitHub, tech blogs
* **Automation**

  * Scheduled scraping of latest papers, preprints, repos
  * RSS, email digests, auto-conference crawlers
* **Meta-enrichment**

  * Auto-fetch PDFs, collect metadata (title, authors, abstract, year, keywords), generate DOI linkage
  * Track citations (Semantic Scholar, Scopus API)

---

### 2.  Intelligence & Structuring

* **Topic clustering**

  * Embeddings (OpenAI/HuggingFace/SBERT), content similarity to categorize by theme
* **Classification & Filtering**

  * Tagging by method (e.g., hierarchical RL, CPG, sim‑to‑real)
  * Relevance score via keyword match + research context
  * Novelty detection: “flashiest stuff this week”
* **Summarization**

  * Auto-generated 2–3 sentence abstracts in plain language
  * Highlight insights, key contributions, novelty
* **Visual Map**

  * Keyword frequency heatmaps, paper cluster graphs, timeline histories

---

### 3.  Review & Annotation

* **Dashboard**

  * Query Papers, filter by topics, venue, relevance, novelty
  * “Must-read”, “Maybe”, “Archive” flags
* **Highlighting & Notes**

  * Annotate in‑dashboard (key quotes, insights, follow-up ideas)
  * Link to your PhD doc outline sections (e.g. “Intro”, “Method”, “Gap”, “Future Work”)
* **Export Options**

  * Format output as Markdown, BibTeX, Zotero/EndNote integration, Google Docs/Notion

---

### 4.  Research Planning & Tracking

* **Idea Management**

  * Capture inspiration: “Maybe test sim-to-real with Soft‑Q‑learning”
  * Tag with context (“midterm experiment”, “side note”)
* **Milestone Scheduling**

  * Integrate with calendar (Outlook, Google): e.g., “Submit IROS paper by Aug 15”
  * Align with conferences, deadlines
* **Progress Logging**

  * Daily or weekly logs: literature read, summaries created, code experiments launched

---

### 5.  Experiment Automation Aid

* **Replicability Assistance**

  * Auto link paper ↔ GitHub repo ↔ code / Docker setup
  * Generate environment setup scripts (Dockerfile, Conda env, requirements.txt)
* **Template Generator**

  * Paper skeletons following ICRA/IROS/IEEE style
  * Presentation templates for conferences
* **Data & Logging Integration**

  * Integrate experiment metrics (tensorboard, Hydra, WandB) into Aster dashboard

---

### 6.  Collaboration & Dissemination

* **Team Workspace**

  * Share curated lists and notes with advisors or collaborators
* **Alerts & Digest**

  * “This week’s top 5 new papers” via email, Slack, or Discord
  * Instant alerts—“New arXiv paper on ‘hierarchical RL + CPG control’!”
* **Publication Assistant**

  * Track where you submitted, dates, reviewer deadlines
  * Create version-controlled drafts (Git/GitHub for papers)

---

### 7.  Self‑Optimization & Intelligence

* **Learning Profile**

  * Track your interests and feedback (“I read more on sim-to-real,” “less on hardware lists”)
  * Aster fine‑tunes its recommendation ranking for you
* **Citation Graph Navigation**

  * See threads backward/forward through citations; discover lineage of ideas
  * Recommend “related papers you haven’t seen yet”
* **Planner Adaptation**

  * Past behavior: “spent too long on unsupervised-only methods”
  * Aster re-balances weekly reading mix by method type

---

### 8.  Final Stage — Synthesis & Publication

* **Auto Summary Toolkit**

  * Generate summary for each chapter
  * Suggest lit‑review structure based on topic clusters
* **Paper-Level Assistant**

  * Auto-detect missing references, propose related citation
  * Contextual suggestions: “Methods section might mention \[XYZ control framework] paper”
* **Publishing Workflow**

  * Export to LaTeX template, auto-format citations
  * Version tracking with Git commits
